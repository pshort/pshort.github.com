title: First look at doom 3

## Why am I doing this?

I have always had an interest in reading code bases in languages that I don't use very often. C and C++ codebases are particular among these because they are languages I studied in school but never really used professionally and I always find it interesting to see what real world C and C++ looks like. I have also always had an interest in games and most of the games I love are written in C or C++ due to performance of the language when using Open-GL or DirectX.
You can imagine my delight then when the code for Doom 3 was finally made open source this week. I hurried over to the github repo and downloaded a copy to start to play. My original (and still current) intention with this goes as far as:

- Load the code in my IDE
- Build the code
- Run it with my Doom 3 pak files 
- Play with the game code a little to see how it works
- Understand as much as possible about the architecture of the engine


## Downloading the code

Downloading the code is pretty simple. The code was released into github and the original release can be found in [TTimos' Doom 3 repository](https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl "Doom 3 repository").
